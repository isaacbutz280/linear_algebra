## Linear Algebra

During the Spring 2021 semester, I took MATH 401, applications of linear algebea. We were assigned weekly project, and I elected to do these in Jupyter notebooks. The notebooks each tackle a differnt linear algebra topic, with topics as follows

- `compression` - My personal favorite, a project about compressing images by using eigenvectors to get the dominant colors. Sadly, due to the size of the images, GitHub won't render it currently
- `convolution` - All about using a kernel to average out a series of data
- `ffield` - Working to solve linear recurrances
- `fit` - Further exploration into least squares, now using it as a way to fit possible models.
- `game_theory` - looking for dominant strategies in a matrix that represents a game
- `lin_prog` - using linear programming to optimize a meal plan
- `lstsq_project` - A look at least square solution, using a machine leanring classifier example.
- `polyhedra_project` - given a set of outward normal vectors, I wanted to find the vertices of the polygon that contained the solution set of vectors.
- `svd` - This projet was less application, instead it was to teach us about singular value decomposition.
- `team_rank` - Used the Massey Method to rank teams, see [Capstone](https://github.com/isaacbutz280/Personal-Projects/tree/main/Capstone) for more on Massey method.
