    "The [Massey Method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenneth_Massey) is a way to rank groups based on a score between them. It is commonly used to rank sports teams. The general setup is a list of games, with a game containing two teams and the score between the two. The score is found by doing `team one's score - team two's score`. So if a games final score is Team A: 40, Team B: 37, then the entry will be Team A, Team B, 3. I have the data in this format already. Now, to do the Massey Method I will be following the shortcut as laid out by [Dr. Justin Wyss-Gallifent](https://www.math.umd.edu/~immortal/) in [this chapter](https://www.math.umd.edu/~immortal/MATH401/ch_team_ranking.pdf)."

Lastly, as per the shortcut method, I will set the last row of `M` to be all 1, and the last entry in `q` to be 0."
